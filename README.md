# A TUI chat client for all the things

I really dislike how much my chromebook lags while trying to use Slack, Discord, and other messaging services. This is my attempt to bring a bunch of messaging services together with a fast interface. That's currently a TUI because cross-platform GUI is hard and I mostly want to send and receive text.

## Platforms
* Slack (no DM support, needs work on accepting more message types)
* Discord (needs better message acking, DM support, and reconnecting)
* Pushbullet (prototype phase)

## TUI
* Unread highlighting
* Colored usernames
* Wrapping message entry
* Scrolling channel names
