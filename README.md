# A TUI chat client for all the things

I really dislike how much my chromebook lags while trying to use Slack, Discord, and other messaging services. This is my attempt to bring a bunch of messaging services together with a fast interface. That's currently a TUI because GUI is hard and I mostly want to send and receive text.

## Platforms
* Slack: DM support questionable, no thread support. Possibly usable.
* Discord: in progress, can load history and that's it

## Planned Other Features
* Command to copy latest URL to the clipboard
* Command to upload a file (this is the only feature that keeps me using the desktop client)
